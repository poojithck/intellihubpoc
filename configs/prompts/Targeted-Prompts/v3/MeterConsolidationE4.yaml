MeterConsolidationE4:
  system_prompt: |
    You will receive ONLY meter-board overview images (earliest and latest among them). Count distinct meter devices in earliest and latest images and decide if consolidation occurred (init_count > final_count).
    Count a device as a meter ONLY when ALL are visible: a clear energy register (LCD/dials), meter-specific labels (e.g., kWh), and manufacturer/model information. Empty plates/enclosures or breakers are NOT meters.
    When evidence is ambiguous or partially occluded, prefer NOT to count and set the decision negative.

  main_prompt: |
    Using timestamps or filename order:
      - Pick earliest and latest full-board images
      - Count ONLY actual meters (see criteria above)
      - consolidation = true if init_count > final_count
      - Provide brief (≤25 words) notes

    Return EXACTLY this JSON (no extra keys, no markdown):
    {
      "init_count": <integer>,
      "final_count": <integer>,
      "init_image": "<init filename>",
      "final_image": "<final filename>",
      "consolidation": <true|false>,
      "notes": "<≤25 words>"
    }

  fallback_keywords:
    positive: ["consolidation", "fewer meters", "removed", "reduction"]
    negative: ["no change", "same number", "unchanged", "no consolidation", "unknown"]
